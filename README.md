# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv3-and-FastAPI


Welcome to the **Object Detection with YOLOv3 and FastAPI** repository! This project showcases the integration of YOLOv3, a powerful object detection algorithm, with FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. The combination of these technologies allows you to create a user-friendly API for real-time object detection in images.

## Features

- Integration of YOLOv3 for accurate object detection.
- FastAPI-based API for easy deployment and interaction.
- Real-time object detection in static images.
- Customizable confidence and NMS threshold options.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to get started with using the Object Detection API:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mohamedamine99/Object-Detection-with-YOLOv3-and-FastAPI.git
